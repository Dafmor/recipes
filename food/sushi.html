        <p>Follow our simple step-by-step guide to rolling your own,</p>
        <p>low-fat, healthy, Japanese sushi</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 nori sheets</li>
            <li>100g skinless salmon fillet (use really fresh), thinly sliced lengthways</li>
            <li>Â¼ cucumber , deseeded, thinly sliced lengthways</li>
            <li>squeeze wasabi , plus extra to serve</li>
            <li>pickled sushi ginger , to serve</li>
            <li>light soy sauce , to serve</li>
            <li>salmon roe , to serve (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <li>First, make the rice. Rinse the sushi rice in a colander, massaging it with your hands until the water runs clear.
                <p>Leave to drain for 15 mins.</p></li>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <li>Put the rice in a saucepan with 200ml water and the sake or mirin, if using.
                <p>Bring to the boil, then cover with a lid, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 20 mins until the liquid is absorbed.</p>
                <p>Remove from the heat. Set aside, covered, for 15-20 mins.</p>
            </li>
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <li>Transfer to a large bowl. Dissolve the sugar, if using, in the vinegar with a good pinch of salt, pour over the rice and mix.
                <p>Cover with a damp tea towel and set aside at room temperature until ready to use.</p>
            </li>
            <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <li>Put 1 nori sheet on a bamboo mat and cover the surface with half of the cooled rice.
                <p>Lay half of the salmon and cucumber slices along the length of the rice in a strip,</p>
                <p>being careful not to overfill it. Run a pea-sized blob of wasabi (more if you like it really hot) along the edge of the filling with your finger.</p>
            <h3>Steo 5</h3>
            <li>Roll up tightly and squeeze to seal when you reach the end. Repeat with the remaining nori, salmon and cucumber, and more wasabi. 
                <p>Slice each roll into 6 pieces, and serve with extra wasabi, ginger, soy sauce and salmon roe, if you like. <em>Will keep in the fridge for 1 day.</em></p>
            </li>
            </li>
        </ol>
